# PARALLEL-VISION
This is a project on Deep Learning using Parallelization done during the course Parallel and Distributed Computing in 5th Semester. In this project i utilised the MNIST dataset to perform handwritten digit classification using data parallelism and data distributed parallelism in PyTorch and TensorFLow frameworks. I was able to achieve notable improvements in training time with upto 182% scaling in comparison to Single GPU training. We performed parallelism using T4 * 2 GPUs provided by Kaggle and were able to train and entire model for MNIST classification in under 100 seconds. The entire details of the project can be found out in the report provided in the repository.
